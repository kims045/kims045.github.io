		 Development of the Ford Thunderbird began in February of 1953, just one month after GM debuted their Corvette Dream Car at the Motorama in New York. Ford would use parts off existing models for their new car, as did Chevy. Ford would also copy the long-nose/short-tail and 102-inch wheelbase of the Jaguar XK120 as did Chevy. But similarities ended there - Ford's answer to the Corvette was not a bare-bones sports car, but rather a stylish and practical personal luxury car.

		Designed for straight-line speed, muscle cars lacked sophisticated chassis, brakes, and suspension, but they were durable, affordable, and fast. Starting in the early sixties, both Ford and Dodge were building cars specifically to compete at the drag strip. Chrysler's 426 cubic-inch Hemi motor was first seen in 1964 and offered in street trim in 1966, including the new Dodge Charger.

		Designed to be a world-class performer while still retaining past heritage, the fourth-generation Corvette's body, frame, and suspension were all new, with spectacular results. Standing-start acceleration to 60-mph dropped to under seven seconds, top-speeds in excess of 140-mph were seen, and the new brake system stopped the car from 70-mph in 173 feet. After delays and much anticipation, C4 Corvette production began in January of 1983, and were sold as 1984 models.
