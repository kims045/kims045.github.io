		 Men sure like their cars. A truly masculine car is one that can traditionally reach an amazing speed, have a cool design that wows girls and provides a trustworthy hobby. But not all men are fascinated by Lamborghinis, Maseratis and Ferraris. Some are more on the classic side, and it’s these ones that will be on the lookout for a old vintage car. Maybe it reminds them of their grandfathers and the time they spent strolling down the street while going to a baseball game. Maybe their dads used to pick them up from school in these unforgettable vehicles. Or maybe they simply like the smell of an old car and they’ve always dreamed of owning a classic vintage car.
		Whatever the case, we’ve put together a list of the greatest 20 vintage cars any man should want to ride at least once in his life. These autos will make any man want to spend more time on the road than inside his house. They’re so amazing they’ll even make women want to have them in their garage. So here’s a list of top 20 vintage cars for women if you are a girl car enthusiast. 

		This Mercedes-Benz model is a classic sports car. It’s also a 2-door coupe, which means it’ll work perfectly for taking your girlfriend on a ride. It comes with a 2996 cc engine, responsible for producing over 212 hp. The 300SL also has an interesting history. In the 1950s, when it was launched in the US, it was predicted it would be the race car of the streets, and yet it somehow managed to become a real racecar. It’s true that the manufacturers performed some modifications in order for this to happen, but the 300SL won the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Eifelrennen, two racing competitions of 1952.
