					Nostalgia also plays a large part in the appeal of classics. All classic car has a history, whether it is interesting or not. Some have achieved great things in their lives, such as competing in and winning awards, overcoming challenges and so far.
					
					<br><br>
					Some popular classics cars made between 1925 and 1948 were the Bentley, Lincoln-Continental, the Studebaker and the Talbot. These cars were distinctive because of their unusual engines and their sleek and impressive body style and design. For instance, the 1929 Blower Bentley with a 41/2 litre had a super charger or air compressor made into the grille of the car. Another determination of a classic car is its power breaks, clutch and its automatic lubrication system. They are cars that come with modifications and restorations.
					The veteran eras of vehicles were from 1888 to 	1904. Karl Benz of Germany created the first car of this era in 1888. Cars in this era were thought to be a novelty item for they were not very useful as a passenger car. Problems with these cars were the fact that they broke down easily and there was not enough fuel supply available to run them. Another problem was that the roadways to drive them on were very rare.

					Brass cars and trucks began during 1890 and 1918. These steam engine and electric motor vehicles were adapted with brass fittings and brass lanterns for headlights. One of the first cars of this era was the early Ford Model T. Manufacturers added gold-tone trim to such cars to create luxury sedans of this period. Popular brass cars of this era were such ones as the 1905, Aero car and the Albany Runabout.
