					Mostly men love cars. A truly masculine car is one that can traditionally reach an amazing speed, have a cool design that makes people envy the car owner and provides a trustworthy hobby. But not all men are fascinated by well-known modern cars. Some are more on the classic side, and it’s these ones that will be on the lookout for an old vintage car. Maybe it reminds them childhood that their grandparents had, maybe their dads used to pick them up from school in these unforgettable vehicles. Or maybe they simply like the unique design of an old car that cannot be find in modern car and they’ve always dreamed of owning a classic vintage car. Whatever the case, here is some classic sports cars that a lot of men would love.

					<b>1955-1963 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing</b><br>
					<br>This Mercedes-Benz model is a classic sports car. It’s also a 2-door coupe which means popular among men. The fact that the 300SL was the fastest production car at the time, means driving to your ad meetings in Manhattan wouldn’t be a bore.
					In the 1950s, when it was launched in the US, it was predicted it would be the race car of the streets, and yet it somehow managed to become a real racecar. It’s true that the manufacturers performed some modifications in order for this to happen, but the 300SL won the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Eifelrennen, two racing competitions of 1952.

					<b>1967 Toyota 2000 GT is another example of sports classic car.</b><br>
					<br>The gorgeous Toyota 2000 GT sports car was a giant commercial flop when it was introduced. The status of Japanese cars in the U.S. market at the time was roughly the equivalent of Korean cars about 15 years ago, and a Japanese car that cost more than a Jaguar E-Type, a Corvette or a Porsche 911 found few takers. Just over 300 were built and the model’s failure continues to haunt Toyota. Incidentally, Toyota has probably had the last laugh here as the 2000 GT is now the only Japanese collectible car worth $1 million. The 2000GT was certainly up to par with the rest of the world's sports car in its performance, however, and a handful were developed by Carroll Shelby for racing in America. But in the end, Toyota chose to focus on the heart of its line-up—namely, family sedans—and they pulled the plug. Though the Toyota 2000GT was short-lived, it now carries a legacy of innovation and sophistication and is regarded as the first Japanese supercar.
