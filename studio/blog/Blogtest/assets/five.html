		Along with a massive growth of America's middle class, history of the modern sports-car begins directly after WW2. Some vehicles were brought back to the United States by returning soldiers after the war. British auto manufacturers were quick to capitalize on America's growing interest in sports cars, and during 1946 to 1952, a handful of small U.S. manufacturers also jumped on board.

		Produced from 1945 through 1949, the MG-TC was one of the first British sports cars to become popular in America. A 1250cc engine produced about 50-horsepower, achieving top speeds of around 80 mph. With skinny spoke wheels, freestanding headlamps, and upright radiator, the MG-TC was basically the same as the pre-war MG-TB it replaced.

		Before Jaguar introduced the XK-120 in 1948, only exotic race machines such as Alfa Romeo, Bugatti and Duesenberg were running dual-overhead-cam engines. The twin-cam XK motor was a marvel of engineering, propelling the six-cylinder roadster to 120 miles-per-hour, making it the fastest production car of its day. The same DOHC engine that powered the Jaguar XK120 would see another two decades of use, including the XK140 and XK150.

		The MG-TD, offered from 1949 through 1953, was a large improvement over the first three T-types. A new, larger chassis featured independent coil suspension, and a higher compression four-cylinder engine produced 54 horsepower. Total MG-TD production was 29,664 units. Unlike the MG-TC, both right-hand and left-hand drive models were offered.
		From 1948 through 1950, Sprint-car/Indy-car builder Frank Kurtis tried his hand at producing his own brand (Kurtis Kraft) of sports cars. After selling less than 50 in two years, Kurtis sold the license to manufacture the cars to radio personality Earl Muntz in 1951, who renamed them the "Muntz Jet". The car featured aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top. Other parts, such as the engines, were sourced from other manufacturers.
