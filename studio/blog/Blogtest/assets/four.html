		Whatever the case, we’ve put together a list of the greatest 20 vintage cars any man should want to ride at least once in his life. These autos will make any man want to spend more time on the road than inside his house. They’re so amazing they’ll even make women want to have them in their garage. So here’s a list of top 20 vintage cars for women if you are a girl car enthusiast. But if you are a man, continue reading.
		So these are top 20 vintage automobiles we have compiled, that a man would like to add to his collection. 
		1955-1963 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing
		This Mercedes-Benz model is a classic sports car. It’s also a 2-door coupe, which means it’ll work perfectly for taking your girlfriend on a ride. It comes with a 2996 cc engine, responsible for producing over 212 hp. The 300SL also has an interesting history. In the 1950s, when it was launched in the US, it was predicted it would be the race car of the streets, and yet it somehow managed to become a real racecar. It’s true that the manufacturers performed some modifications in order for this to happen, but the 300SL won the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Eifelrennen, two racing competitions of 1952.
		 

		1955-1975 Citroen DS
		The Citroen DS is yet another vintage car one absolutely must own. It’s classified as a mid-size luxury car and it comes in 3 variants: a 4-door sedan, a 5-door station wagon and a 2-door convertible. Whatever the model you choose, you’ll get engines between 1.9 L and 2.34 L. At the time it was launched, Europe was still trying to recover from WWII, which unfortunately came in the way of sales success. Citroen are even now known for their high price, which is why the French manufacturer had to introduce a different and cheaper model, the ID (1957).
