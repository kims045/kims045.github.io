Consistent icons are icons that are easily understood by people, which is universial. 
<br>For example, simple icons such as app icons.

<br>
Different icons are icons that can be interpret in different ways depending on people, culture, situation, etc. 
<br>For example, major company's logo 'Apple' can be used as an actual apple farm.

(I AM A MAN poster)
<br><br>
This poster consists a lot of meanings, it can be describe in a lot of different aspects based on it's historical time, purposes, and more. <br> It is also used as book title, art, and plays and in film to assert the rights of all people to be treated with dignity.
